With COVID-19 outbreak limiting all travelling options, it was a perfect time to visit the city of Dubrovnik for the first time.
Start of November, sunny weekend and a minimal number of tourists resulted with 3 photo series.

[The first - Lokrum]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _galleries/lokrum.md %}) is on an island next to the city of Dubrovnik.
